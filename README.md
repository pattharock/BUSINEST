# **COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 2: COURSE PROJECT**
## **Title : Comprehensive Accounting Program** 
## **Platfrom: C++**

### Problem Statement

 With the recent growth in the Startup Culture and Booming Businesses, the need for a technological platform for Wealth Management becomes necessary. Thus, through the course of this project, we aim to develop a *Comprehensive Accounting Program* which serves as a tool for firms to manage and oversee their financial state and as a result, make business decisions. The implementation of this software will enable firms to monitor and record their transactions, account for their assets, liabilities and equities, and asses their present situation with respect to debts, cashflow, and goodwill etc. via various *financial statements* and *accounting ratios.*

### Problem Setting

As previously stated, one of the main purpose of our project is to assist firms in making better decisions in the near future. Our first assumption relies on the fact that this project is *solely based upon the finances of companies and firms* rather than individuals. As companies add a new entry, they will be asked whether it is an expense or an income. Depending on their answer, the entry will be adjusted accordingly. Firms can always look up details on their transactions such as dates, types or amount. But the main usefulness of this project is that it accumulates all the data and provides an overall state of the business to the company through various statistics, such as *ratio analysis*, *threshold expense*, and year end *income statements* and *balance sheets*.


### Functionality and Key Features

- The program records every expense and revenue made by the company and keeps track of its assets and liabilities.

- All transactions will include amount, the date and the classifications (Asset, Liability or Equity).

- Records can be added, deleted, modified, viewed at any time.

- The program will alert the company if expenses exceed a certain threshold. 

- The program will provide feedback to the company regarding certain data, such as monthly income and expenses, increasing amount of debts etc.

- One additional function within the program will be used to prepare financial statements such as income statement and balance sheet for the company to reflect upon their financial position.

- Using all the year end data, the program  will calculate various financial ratios to determine the profitability, efficiency , return on Investment, return on Assets etc. of the company which will aid future decision making process.
